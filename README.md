## Handling Merge Issues

### Scenario

You attempted to push changes from your `development` branch to the `features/walkthrough` branch but encountered a "non-fast-forward" error.

### Resolution Steps

1. **Fetch and Review Remote Branch:**
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git checkout features/walkthrough
   git merge origin/features/walkthrough
